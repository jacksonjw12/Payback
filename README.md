<h1>Payback</h1>
<h3>Use your anger for good.</h3>


<h4>Payback lets you use your frustration about world events to enact change. We'll direct you to the foundations that are making a difference based on the day's current events and the causes near to your heart.</h4>


<h4>PayBack is an application that lets users view quotes, tweets, and articles that concern current events that threaten minority groups and human rights. They are followed by links to charities that users can visit to help out.</h4>
